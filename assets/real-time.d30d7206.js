<p>LiveGraph obviates the need for that by detecting relevant changes in the underlying database, filtering updates based on client\u2019s access permissions and pushing relevant updates to the client in real-time. In other words, it allows a client to subscribe to a query and receive push notifications whenever the results of the query change.</p>
